# Protocol Infrastructure & Economic Framework

## ENGLISH VERSION

### 1. Nature of the Operation: Decentralized IaaS
* **Bilateral Service Layer**: SecClaw is a non-custodial matching engine for computational labor. Revenue is strictly generated by the User's own hardware specifications (**CAPEX**) and operational costs (**OPEX**).
* **Ministerial Dispatch**: The protocol utilizes a neutral, open-source algorithm to pair supply and demand. The developers do not exercise discretionary management over the outcomes or pricing, which are determined by the global AI token benchmark.
* **Service-Based Revenue**: Any fees collected within the IaaS layer are classified as software licensing and maintenance fees (SaaS), not financial spreads.

### 2. RWA Framework: Proprietary Inventory Disposition
* **Private Asset Assignment**: Crowdsocio facilitates the **discovery and reservation** for the assignment of proprietary credit rights. This is a private disposition of assets owned by the developers (KPI Hunters), not a collective investment scheme or public offering.
* **Non-Automated Title Transfer**: Legal title finality is NOT automated via smart contract. It remains strictly subject to mandatory manual review, credit analysis, and formal approval by the regulated administrator (e.g., Ademicon), pursuant to **Law 11.795/2008**.
* **Inventory Model**: The "Genesis Inventory" consists of pre-existing, legally acquired titles. The protocol acts as a matching interface between the title holder and the assignee, ensuring all financial flows for restricted jurisdictions occur through traditional banking channels.

### 3. Strict Jurisdictional Nuance & Geo-Fencing
* **RWA Tokenization Restriction**: Access to the blockchain-based settlement layer for Real-World Assets (RWA) is strictly prohibited for residents of **Brazil and the United States**. 
* **Brazilian Compliance**: For residents of Brazil, the platform operates exclusively as a "Matching & Lead Generation" interface. Financial settlement for the assignment of rights must be conducted in National Currency (BRL) outside the protocol's digital settlement layer to comply with BACEN regulations.
* **Non-Solicitation Policy**: Any bypass of geo-fencing via VPN to access RWA tokenization features is a breach of the Terms of Service. The developers do not conduct any public offerings of securities in restricted jurisdictions.

### 4. Fiscal and Legal Finality
* **Tax Compliance**: All transactions involving the disposition of proprietary assets are subject to applicable local taxation, including capital gains tax, as reported by the respective asset owners.
* **Settlement Distinction**: Native digital assets (e.g., **POL, HYPE, BTC**) are used exclusively as a technical settlement layer for international IaaS requesters and are not available for credit right acquisition within restricted fiduciary frameworks.

⚠️ OPERATIONAL RISK DISCLOSURE

1. Professional Participation
This protocol is designed for sophisticated Service Providers and Asset Acquirers who understand the risks of decentralized infrastructure. It is not an "investment product" for passive retail actors.

2. Manual Validation Requirement
The transfer of Real-World Assets (RWA) is contingent upon third-party approval (Consortium Administrator). The protocol facilitates the commercial intent, but legal title finality occurs through traditional regulated channels (BACEN).

3. Unauthorized Use
Bypassing geo-restrictions to access crypto-settlement for RWA constitutes a fraudulent act. Users in restricted jurisdictions assume all legal consequences for unauthorized interaction with the interface's digital asset layer.

4. Irreversibility and Custody
All digital settlements for IaaS are final. Users are the sole custodians of their private keys and operational parameters. For RWA transactions in Brazil, no funds are held by the protocol; all payments follow the legal process of assignment of rights.
